Using the SDK library
=====================

## Installation
To add the `JWPlayerKit` SDK as a dependency to your project, you have 
couple of options: Using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.

### Using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)
Add the following lines to the `Podfile` of your project and replace the 
`Version Number` with the desired version of the `JWPlayerKit`.

```ruby
pod 'JWPlayerKit', '~> Version Number'
```

Execute `pod install` to install the new `JWPlayerKit` dependency.

### Using Swift Package Manager
Open Xcode 14+, navigate to your Project file and specify it in `Project > 
Package Dependencies` using the following URL:

```
https://github.com/jwplayer/JWPlayerKit-package.git
```
